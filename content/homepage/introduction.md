## Welcome
This website summarizes the main results from our preprint available on [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.973271v2). 

It was written by Chenfu Shi as an addition to the poster presented at the Wellcome Epigenomics of Common Diseases 2020 online conference to make our results clearer and more accessible.

##### Functional genomics of common diseases

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)  have linked a large number of genetic variants to psoriasis and other complex diseases. These variants however do not directly affect the coding region of genes but instead often lie in regulatory regions such as enhancers. These can that act through long range mechanisms and it may therefore be difficult to assign them to a specific gene. Moreover, regulatory regions are highly dynamic and context specific, requiring us to study them in disease relevant tissues and samples.

The objective in our lab is to use functional genomics techniques to uncover the underlying  biological mechanisms that can contribute to disease risk.

In the figure below you can see an example of our general workflow:

- An example GWAS loci contains multiple SNPs far away from genes making it difficult understanding their role in disease.
- We apply a combination of techniques such as ChIP-seq, eQTL and chromatin conformation. 
- This results in a better understanding of the functional aspects underlying this loci such as identifying which genes are affected.
