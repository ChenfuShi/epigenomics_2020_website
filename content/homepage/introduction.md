##### Functional genomics of common diseases

- Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)  have linked a large number of genetic variants to psoriasis and other complex diseases. 
- Variants often lie in regulatory regions such as enhancers that can act through long range mechanisms and it may therefore be difficult to assign them to a specific gene.
- Moreover, regulatory regions are highly dynamic and context specific, requiring us to study them in disease relevant tissues and samples.
- Our aim is to use functional genomics techniques to uncover the underlying  biological mechanisms that can contribute to disease risk.
- GWAS SNPs are enriched in active regulatory regions specifically in the cell types relevant to the trait studied.
- Here we used HiChIP to study the chromatin conformation in cells derived from Human Keratinocytes (HaCaT) and skin-plaque derived CD8 T cells (MyLa).
