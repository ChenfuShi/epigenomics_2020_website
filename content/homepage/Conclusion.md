## Conclusion

Chromatin conformation and functional genomics studies have the potential to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive the disease susceptibility of many complex traits. Here we used H3K27ac HiChIP, a novel technique that allows combined analysis of both chromatin conformation and chromatin activity, to create the first global study of promoter-enhancer interactions in keratinocyte and CD8+ T cell lines. 

We use this data to explore disease associated SNPs for Psoriatic Arthritis, Psoriasis, Atopic Dermatitis, Melanoma and Systemic Sclerosis, and identify all the genes that are linked by chromatin interactions to these variants. All of these results are available on the bioRxiv preprint and further updates will come when our article is published.

The HiChIP gene targets have the potential to be used as therapeutic targets in drug repurposing and discovery, as recently applied for other diseases. However, whilst the techniques used in this study are an important strategy to identify potential candidate genes, they require further individual experimental validation (such as genetic perturbation techniques) before they can be used for drug targeting.

Regardless, we hope that these genes and mechanisms identified here represent a useful resource for further research aimed at characterising how genetic variation impacts on disease susceptibility for these and other complex diseases.
