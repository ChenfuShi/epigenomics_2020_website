##### Using these datasets to investigate the underlying mechanisms in disease associated loci

We first looked at the ETS1 locus in particular. Here psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have distinct associations. However, whilst the psoriasis associated variants overlap the promoter of ETS1 directly, the association with atopic dermatitis is located 130 kb downstream of the gene.

Using our HiChIP interactions we can link the atopic dermatitis associated variants with the ETS1 promoter. This suggests a putative mechanism in which these two disting associations are mediated by a single gene.
