##### GWAS SNPs affect elements that are highly cell type specific

The majority of GWAS SNPs has been associated with enhancer regions that are highly cell type and condition specific. This requires the study of these loci in cell types that are relevant to the traits studied.

For example dermtalogical conditions such as psoriasis are known to enrich in cell types such as keratinocytes.

Despite this most previous studies have focused on immune cell types derived from blood as these are simpler to isolate and study.

**Here we used H3K27ac HiChIP, Hi-C and RNA-seq to study the global chromatin conformation and activity in cells derived from Human Keratinocytes (HaCaT) and a CD8 T cell line derived from a cancerous skin-plaque (MyLa).**
