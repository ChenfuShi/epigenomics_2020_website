Another example of a novel gene target can be found at the 1p36 locus (rs10794648), which to-date has been associated with IFNLR1. However, our HiChIP data showed long-range interactions between the Ps SNPs at 1p36 and the distal gene GRHL3 primarily in HaCaT keratinocytes. GRHL3 encodes a transcription factor which stimulates keratinocyte migration and has previously been independently linked to psoriasis.
