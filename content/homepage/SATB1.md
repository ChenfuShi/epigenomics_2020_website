##### Linking genes with psoriasis loci

We then focused on 4 psoriasis loci which show previously unknown candidate genes.

The first one is the SATB1 locus. Here we link the psoriasis SNP rs73178598 to SATB1 which is located 240kb away.
This gene is an important regulator of regulatory T cells and autoimmunity.
